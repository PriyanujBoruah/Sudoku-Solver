# Sudoku Solver and Generator

This Python code provides a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles and generates a large set of Sudoku puzzles for testing and analysis.

## Features

* **Backtracking Algorithm:** Implements a recursive backtracking approach for efficient solutions.
* **Validity Checks:** Includes functions to verify row, column, and 3x3 box constraints.
* **Timer:** Measures and displays the solution time for each puzzle and calculates the average time across a large dataset.
* **Puzzle Generation:** Generates a set of Sudoku puzzles (currently using a placeholder â€“ see below).
* **Bulk Testing:** Solves a large number of puzzles (default is 1,000,000) to evaluate performance.
* **Clear Output:**  Prints the number of valid puzzles, total solution time, and average solution time.
* **Copy Protection:** `copy.deepcopy()` protects the original input boards during solving.

## Usage

**1. Running the Solver/Generator:**

```bash
python sudoku_solver.py
```

This will:

* Generate 1,000,000 Sudoku puzzles (you can change this number).
* Solve each puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
* Print the total number of valid (solvable) puzzles, total solution time, and the average solution time across all valid puzzles.


**2. Using the Solver Function Directly:**

The `solve_sudoku(board)` function can be imported and used independently:

```python
import sudoku_solver  # Assuming the code is saved as sudoku_solver.py
import time

board = [
   # ... Your Sudoku puzzle (2D list) ...
]

start_time = time.time()
solution = sudoku_solver.solve_sudoku(board)
end_time = time.time()

if solution:
    # ... Use the solved board ...
    print("Time taken:", end_time - start_time, "seconds")
else:
    print("No solution found.")

```

## Puzzle Generation (Important Note)

The current `generate_sudoku()` function creates a *single* base puzzle and then shuffles its rows. This does not provide a wide variety of Sudoku puzzles.  For proper performance testing and meaningful results, you should implement a more robust Sudoku generation algorithm that creates genuinely distinct puzzles.  This is crucial for accurately assessing the solver's performance across different difficulty levels.

## Performance Analysis

The code generates and solves a large number of Sudoku puzzles (default 1,000,000). The average solving time provides a good measure of the algorithm's efficiency.  The results will be affected by:

* **Puzzle Difficulty Distribution:**  A robust generator should produce puzzles of varying difficulty.
* **Hardware:** Your computer's processing power (CPU, RAM) directly affects the solution time.
* **Algorithm Optimizations:** Any changes to the backtracking algorithm will impact performance.


## Example Input (for `solve_sudoku()` function)

```
board = [
    [7, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],
    # ... and so on (9x9 grid)
]
